### Towards Optimal Transport with Global Invariances

#### 1. What is the task tackled in this paper ?

- Optimal transport problem
- Specific problems : Unsupervised word embedding alignment

#### 2. What is the research question in this paper ?

- Tranditional method assume that two distributions are in one space and this is unusual in real data. In that situation, they can't cacluate the distance across the two spaces. 
- They only deal with the discrete formulation of optimal transport problem

#### 3. How to solve it/what is the approach of this paper ?

- Give a global geometric transformations modified formulation of the discrete optimal transport problem. 
- Design and analysis of efficient algorithms for the case of rigid transformations(linear transformation)
